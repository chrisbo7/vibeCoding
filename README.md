# Surprise Script

A small Python script that shows a friendly surprise popup for a colleague using Tkinter.

Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (Tkinter included on standard installations)

Run
Open a Windows command prompt and run:

```cmd
python surprise.py "Colleague Name"
```

Or run without arguments to be prompted interactively:

```cmd
python surprise.py
```

Notes
- If Tkinter isn't available (headless or missing GUI), the script will print the message to the console instead.
- The repository includes `test_surprise.py` with a few simple tests. Run them with `pytest` (if installed):

```cmd
pytest -q
```
